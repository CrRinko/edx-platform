        In fill-in-the-blank problems, also known as "text input" problems, learners enter text into a response field. The text can include letters and characters such as punctuation marks. The text that the learner enters must match your specified answer text exactly.
        To create a fill-in-the-blank problem in the simple editor:
        1. Enter the text of the main question between two pairs of angle brackets that point inward (>><<).
        2. On a new line, enter an equal sign (=) followed by a space and the text of the correct answer.
        3. (optional) To specify more than one answer, on a new line, enter "or=" followed by a space and the text of the answer. Repeat this step for each additional correct answer.

         You can use the following example problem as a model.
