       Studio offers three types of problems that allow learners to select one or more options from a list that you provide.
       - Checkbox problems allow learners to select multiple options. Learners can see all the options along with the problem text.
       - Dropdown problems allow learners to select only one option. Learners only see all the options after they click the dropdown list.
       - Multiple choice problems allow learners to select only one option. Learners can see all the options along with the problem text.

       To create a multiple choice problem in the simple editor:
       1. Enter the text of the main question between angle brackets.
       2. Enter each answer option on a separate line.
       3. Add parentheses that contain a space before each answer option: ( )
       4. For the correct answer, add an x between the parentheses: (x)
       - To add an explanation, enter the text of the explanation, and then highlight the explanation and click the light bulb icon.

       You can use the following example problem as a model.
